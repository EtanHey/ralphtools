Let's get started with auditing the codebase and creating comprehensive documentation. Before we proceed, let's first check if any of the output files already exist:

```sh
ls -la ollama-small*
```

This will list all files that start with "ollama-small". If any of these files exist, please review them before proceeding to avoid duplication.

Once you've reviewed any existing files or determined that they don't exist, I'll guide you through the steps to audit every file and create the necessary documentation.
