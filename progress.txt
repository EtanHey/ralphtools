# Ralph Progress - ralphtools v1.4 Implementation

## Project
- Repo: ~/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools
- PRD: prd-json/

## Learnings
- zsh subshells don't share global variables with parent - use temp files for result tracking

---

## Iterations

## Iteration 1 - TEST-001 Test Framework
- Model: opus
- Created tests/test-ralph.zsh with full zsh test framework
- Added assertion helpers: assert_equals, assert_contains, assert_exit_code, assert_not_empty, assert_file_exists
- Added test output functions: test_start, test_pass, test_fail
- Implemented file-based result tracking for reliable pass/fail counts
- Test runner discovers and runs all test_* functions
- Summary shows "X passed, Y failed" at end
- Exit code 0 on success, 1 on failure
- zsh -n syntax check passes
- Framework includes 5 self-validation tests that all pass
