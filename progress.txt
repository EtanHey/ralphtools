# Ralph Progress - Fresh Start
Started: Fri Jan 23 21:57:15 IST 2026

(Previous progress archived to docs.local/prd-archive/)

## Iteration 1
Story: AUDIT-001 - Audit README.md for accuracy and relevance
Status: BLOCKED
Reason: AUDIT-001 depends on US-073 (Deprecate -G -H -K model flags) which is still pending.
The acceptance criteria "Remove -G -H -K examples (deprecated per US-073)" cannot be completed until US-073 is done.
Moved AUDIT-001 to blocked array, set nextStory to BUG-013.

### Learnings
- Always check dependencies[] field in story JSON before starting
- If a dependency story is not completed, the dependent story should be blocked

## Iteration 2
Story: BUG-013 - Debug output 'remaining_stats' still leaking to display
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Added `setopt localoptions noxtrace` to 10+ helper functions to prevent xtrace output leakage
- Functions guarded: _ralph_format_elapsed, _ralph_show_iteration_status, _ralph_get_story_criteria_progress, _ralph_get_total_criteria, _ralph_update_criteria_display_at_row, _ralph_update_stories_display_at_row, _ralph_handle_file_change, _ralph_handle_file_change_with_rows, _ralph_start_polling_loop, _ralph_ntfy
- Added debug output auditing section to docs/configuration.md with grep commands
- Added comment "# DEBUG OUTPUT - guard with RALPH_DEBUG_LIVE" above _ralph_debug_live function

### Learnings
- The xtrace output format `var='value value'` with single quotes indicates zsh trace output, not explicit echo
- `setopt localoptions noxtrace` prevents xtrace leakage within function scope
- Even if parent function sets noxtrace, it's good practice to guard all helper functions defensively
