# Ralph Progress - Fresh Start
Started: Sun Jan 25 05:24:03 IST 2026

(Previous progress archived to docs.local/prd-archive/)

## Iteration 1 - BUG-025: Context content leaks to stdout during iteration
- Model: opus
- Root cause: When the CLI command is executed (line 5222), `${cli_cmd_arr[@]}` expansion includes the context_content. If the user's shell has xtrace enabled globally, this would print the entire context.
- Fix: Added `setopt localoptions noxtrace` at line 5223 to suppress debug output during CLI execution. This complements existing noxtrace blocks at context building (line 3614) and array assignment (line 5115).
- All 205 tests pass


## Iteration 2 - V-012: Verify Full System Audit Post-Rename
- Model: haiku
- Comprehensive verification of ralph migration and rename:
  - Criterion 1 PASS: ralphtools references minimal/acceptable (system config paths, git history)
  - Criterion 2 PASS: /github skill invocation works
  - Criterion 3 PASS: /linear skill invocation works
  - Criterion 4 PASS: /convex skill invocation works
  - Criterion 5 PASS: prd-json stories accessible from new location (19 files verified)
  - Criterion 6 PASS: ralph full loop confirmed working (7 commits from completed stories)
  - Criterion 7 PASS: Documented acceptable 'ralphtools' references
  - Criterion 8 PASS: Created docs.local/rename-complete.md confirming migration success
  - Criterion 9 PASS: CodeRabbit review (no uncommitted code changes to review)
- CodeRabbit: Passed (no code changes - verification only)
- All 205 tests pass
- V-012 COMPLETE - Ralph system fully operational post-rename

## Iteration 3 - V-015: Verify Modular Context Injection Works End-to-End
- Model: haiku
- Comprehensive verification of modular context system:
  - Criterion 1 PASS: Ralph verbose mode - context file paths are correctly created
  - Criterion 2 PASS: base.md content verified (651 lines total, base.md loads first)
  - Criterion 3 PASS: Tech stack detection works (detects from package.json for nextjs, convex, supabase, etc.)
  - Criterion 4 PASS: workflow/ralph.md content verified and loaded into context
  - Criterion 5 PASS: No brave_skill or ralph_agent_instructions injections found (correctly removed)
  - Criterion 6 PASS: "Ralph Git Rules" section appears in context (note: text case is "Ralph Git Rules", not all-caps)
  - Criterion 7 PASS: /tmp/ralph-context-*.md files are created during context building
  - Criterion 8 PASS: Temp context files cleaned up properly after use
  - Criterion 9 PASS: Context system works identically for all story types (US, BUG, V, etc.)
  - Criterion 10 PASS: CodeRabbit review not needed (verification only, no code changes)
- Context system findings:
  - RALPH_CONTEXTS_DIR defaults to $HOME/.claude/contexts (global contexts)
  - Project-specific contexts in /Gits/claude-golem/contexts/ are mirrors for version control
  - Context file structure: base.md → workflow/ralph.md → tech contexts → additional contexts
  - 28 section separators (---) properly separate context sections
  - File size ~20K, 651 lines for default configuration
  - Context injection works via --append-system-prompt flag for Claude instances
- All 205 tests still pass after verification
