# Ralph Progress - v2 Skills + Bug Fixes

Started: Fri Jan 23 14:56:32 IST 2026

## Iteration 1 - US-032: Skills Discovery command (/skills)
**Status**: COMPLETED

Created `/skills` command that:
- Scans ~/.claude/commands/ for all installed skills
- Detects both single-file (.md) and multi-file (SKILL.md) formats
- Extracts descriptions from YAML frontmatter or first blockquote
- Groups skills by category (Infrastructure, Domain, Custom)
- Shows skill source (ralphtools, superpowers, ralph-config, custom)
- Counts workflows for progressive disclosure skills
- Supports --search keyword filtering

Files created:
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/skills.md
- Symlinked to ~/.claude/commands/skills.md

### Learnings
- Skills use YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields
- Multi-file skills have SKILL.md at root with workflows/ subdirectory
- Source detection via symlink resolution (readlink -f)

## Iteration 2 - US-033: Linear skill (API wrapper)
**Status**: COMPLETED

Created `/linear` skill that replaces the need for Linear MCP:
- Uses curl with Linear's GraphQL API (https://api.linear.app/graphql)
- API key stored in 1Password, retrieved via `op read`
- Progressive disclosure architecture: SKILL.md router + 4 workflow files

Files created:
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/linear/SKILL.md - Router with quick actions table
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/linear/workflows/create-issue.md - Create issues with priority, labels, assignee
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/linear/workflows/list-issues.md - Query/filter/search issues
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/linear/workflows/update-issue.md - Update state, assignee, priority, add comments
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/linear/workflows/create-worktree.md - Create git worktree from Linear issue
- Symlinked to ~/.claude/commands/linear

### Learnings
- Linear API uses GraphQL at https://api.linear.app/graphql
- Auth: `Authorization: <API_KEY>` (no Bearer prefix for API keys)
- Linear auto-generates branch names for issues via `branchName` field
- Rate limit: 1,500 requests/hour with API key auth
- GraphQL returns 200 even on errors - always check `errors` array

## Iteration 3 - US-034: Convex skill (CLI wrapper)
**Status**: COMPLETED

Created `/convex` skill that wraps the npx convex CLI:
- Progressive disclosure architecture: SKILL.md router + 6 workflow files
- Auto-detects Convex project by checking for `convex/` directory
- Handles CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY from 1Password for CI/CD production deploys

Files created:
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/convex/SKILL.md - Router with quick actions table
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/convex/workflows/dev.md - Start dev server with hot reload
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/convex/workflows/deploy.md - Production deployment with deploy key
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/convex/workflows/run-function.md - Execute queries, mutations, actions
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/convex/workflows/data-export.md - Export database to zip
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/convex/workflows/data-import.md - Import data with safety warnings
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/convex/workflows/schema.md - Schema inspection and validation
- Symlinked to ~/.claude/commands/convex

### Learnings
- Convex CLI commands: dev, deploy, run, export, import, codegen, env, dashboard
- Deploy key format: `prod:...` for production access
- Function path format: `filename:functionName` (no .ts extension)
- Always backup before import - import can overwrite data
- Schema changes can be destructive - export first
