## Iteration 1
Story: AUDIT-001 - Audit README.md for accuracy and relevance
Status: BLOCKED
Reason: AUDIT-001 depends on US-073 (Deprecate -G -H -K model flags) which is still pending.
The acceptance criteria "Remove -G -H -K examples (deprecated per US-073)" cannot be completed until US-073 is done.
Moved AUDIT-001 to blocked array, set nextStory to BUG-013.

### Learnings
- Always check dependencies[] field in story JSON before starting
- If a dependency story is not completed, the dependent story should be blocked
