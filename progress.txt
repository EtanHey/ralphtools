# Ralph Progress - v2 Skills + Bug Fixes

Started: Fri Jan 23 14:56:32 IST 2026

## Iteration 1 - US-032: Skills Discovery command (/skills)
**Status**: COMPLETED

Created `/skills` command that:
- Scans ~/.claude/commands/ for all installed skills
- Detects both single-file (.md) and multi-file (SKILL.md) formats
- Extracts descriptions from YAML frontmatter or first blockquote
- Groups skills by category (Infrastructure, Domain, Custom)
- Shows skill source (ralphtools, superpowers, ralph-config, custom)
- Counts workflows for progressive disclosure skills
- Supports --search keyword filtering

Files created:
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/skills.md
- Symlinked to ~/.claude/commands/skills.md

### Learnings
- Skills use YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields
- Multi-file skills have SKILL.md at root with workflows/ subdirectory
- Source detection via symlink resolution (readlink -f)

## Iteration 2 - US-033: Linear skill (API wrapper)
**Status**: COMPLETED

Created `/linear` skill that replaces the need for Linear MCP:
- Uses curl with Linear's GraphQL API (https://api.linear.app/graphql)
- API key stored in 1Password, retrieved via `op read`
- Progressive disclosure architecture: SKILL.md router + 4 workflow files

Files created:
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/linear/SKILL.md - Router with quick actions table
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/linear/workflows/create-issue.md - Create issues with priority, labels, assignee
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/linear/workflows/list-issues.md - Query/filter/search issues
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/linear/workflows/update-issue.md - Update state, assignee, priority, add comments
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/linear/workflows/create-worktree.md - Create git worktree from Linear issue
- Symlinked to ~/.claude/commands/linear

### Learnings
- Linear API uses GraphQL at https://api.linear.app/graphql
- Auth: `Authorization: <API_KEY>` (no Bearer prefix for API keys)
- Linear auto-generates branch names for issues via `branchName` field
- Rate limit: 1,500 requests/hour with API key auth
- GraphQL returns 200 even on errors - always check `errors` array

## Iteration 3 - US-034: Convex skill (CLI wrapper)
**Status**: COMPLETED

Created `/convex` skill that wraps the npx convex CLI:
- Progressive disclosure architecture: SKILL.md router + 6 workflow files
- Auto-detects Convex project by checking for `convex/` directory
- Handles CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY from 1Password for CI/CD production deploys

Files created:
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/convex/SKILL.md - Router with quick actions table
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/convex/workflows/dev.md - Start dev server with hot reload
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/convex/workflows/deploy.md - Production deployment with deploy key
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/convex/workflows/run-function.md - Execute queries, mutations, actions
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/convex/workflows/data-export.md - Export database to zip
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/convex/workflows/data-import.md - Import data with safety warnings
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/convex/workflows/schema.md - Schema inspection and validation
- Symlinked to ~/.claude/commands/convex

### Learnings
- Convex CLI commands: dev, deploy, run, export, import, codegen, env, dashboard
- Deploy key format: `prod:...` for production access
- Function path format: `filename:functionName` (no .ts extension)
- Always backup before import - import can overwrite data
- Schema changes can be destructive - export first

## Iteration 4 - US-036: Install Wizard skill
**Status**: COMPLETED

Created `/ralph-install` skill that guides new users through ralphtools setup:
- Progressive disclosure architecture: SKILL.md router + 5 workflow files
- Checks for all required CLIs (gh, op, gum, fswatch, jq, git)
- Guides brew installation of missing dependencies
- Helps configure API tokens in 1Password
- Creates skill symlinks in ~/.claude/commands/
- Validates entire installation end-to-end

Files created:
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/ralph-install/SKILL.md - Router with workflow table and troubleshooting
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/ralph-install/workflows/check-deps.md - Dependency verification scripts
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/ralph-install/workflows/install-deps.md - Homebrew installation guide
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/ralph-install/workflows/setup-tokens.md - 1Password token configuration
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/ralph-install/workflows/setup-symlinks.md - Skill symlink creation
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/ralph-install/workflows/validate.md - Post-install validation
- Symlinked to ~/.claude/commands/ralph-install

### Learnings
- Install wizards benefit from step-by-step workflow separation
- Include troubleshooting in main SKILL.md for quick reference
- Validation scripts with pass/fail counts give clear status

## Iteration 5 - US-037: Separate notification channels (Ralph vs Claude)
**Status**: COMPLETED

Implemented separate ntfy topics for Ralph and Claude:
- Ralph topics are per-project: `etans-ralph-<project>` (same project shares topic)
- Claude topic is fixed: `etans-ralphClaude` (never mixes with Ralph)
- Added configurable prefix via RALPH_NTFY_PREFIX
- All Ralph notifications now include [Ralph] prefix in title

Files modified:
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/ralph.zsh - Updated defaults and notification function
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/docs/notifications.md - Created topic naming documentation

### Learnings
- Per-project topics allow subscribing only to active projects
- Fixed Claude topic ensures Claude alerts are never buried in Ralph iterations
- [Ralph] prefix in title makes notifications easily identifiable at a glance

## Iteration 6 - US-038: Session isolation via git worktree
**Status**: COMPLETED

Implemented worktree-based session isolation to keep Ralph from polluting main project's Claude /resume history:

Commands added:
- `ralph-start [args]` - Creates worktree at ~/worktrees/<repo>/ralph-session, outputs cd + ralph command
- `ralph-cleanup [--force]` - Merges changes back to main repo, removes worktree

How it works:
- Claude sessions are stored per-directory in ~/.claude/projects/
- Each directory path gets its own session storage
- Git worktrees create a linked copy at a different path
- Claude sees worktree as a separate project → separate session history
- `/resume` in main project stays clean (no Ralph iterations)

Files created/modified:
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/ralph.zsh - Added ralph-start, ralph-cleanup, _ralph_output_worktree_command
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/docs/session-isolation.md - Full documentation
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/prd-json/AGENTS.md - Added worktree workflow section

### Learnings
- Claude sessions stored in ~/.claude/projects/ with path encoded (dashes replace slashes)
- Worktrees at different paths get completely separate session histories
- Must copy prd-json/ and progress.txt to worktree for Ralph to work
- ralph-cleanup syncs state back before removing worktree
- git worktree prune cleans up stale references

## Iteration 7 - US-039: UI guards (prevent 104%, fix cost alignment)
**Status**: COMPLETED

Fixed UI display bugs to prevent impossible values:
- Progress percentage now capped at 100% max
- Stats sanity check: completed capped at total (handles 49/47 → 47/47 case)
- Warning log written to RALPH_LOG_FILE when stats are inconsistent
- Fixed cost box right-side alignment using consistent BOX_INNER_WIDTH=61
- Replaced complex padding formula with simpler `(BOX_INNER_WIDTH - display_width)`

Files modified:
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/ralph.zsh
  - `_ralph_progress_bar()`: Added `(( percent > 100 )) && percent=100`
  - `_ralph_draw_progress_line()`: Added sanity check for completed > total
  - `_ralph_show_prd_json()`: Added sanity check for completed > total
  - Multiple box drawing sections: Fixed padding formula to use consistent BOX_INNER_WIDTH

### Learnings
- Box drawing: 65-char wide box = 61-char inner content (between `│  ` and `│`)
- Padding formula should be `(BOX_INNER_WIDTH - display_width)` not complex subtraction
- Always cap percentages defensively even if input should be valid
- Log warnings for data inconsistencies to help debug root causes

## Iteration 8 - US-040: 1Password detection fix (check actual config)
**Status**: COMPLETED

Fixed 1Password status display to accurately reflect whether 1Password Environments are configured:

Problem:
- Previously showed "Available (secrets via 1Password Environments)" just because op CLI was installed
- User hadn't actually configured 1Password Environments for the project

Solution:
- Added `_ralph_check_op_environments()` function that checks for actual configuration:
  - Looks for `.env.1password` file
  - Checks for `op://` references in `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development`, etc.
  - Checks for `op://` references in `package.json`
- Updated status display in main `ralph` function to show three states:
  1. "Available (secrets via 1Password Environments)" - CLI + signed in + configured
  2. "CLI available (environments not configured)" - CLI + signed in but no op:// refs
  3. "CLI available but not signed in" - CLI installed but not authenticated
  4. "Not installed (using environment variables)" - no op CLI
- Added new "Configure 1Password Environments" option to `ralph-setup` wizard
- Created `_ralph_setup_configure_op_environments()` helper function

Files modified:
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/ralph.zsh
  - Added `_ralph_check_op_environments()` global function (lines 4703-4729)
  - Updated main ralph function 1Password status display (lines 2441-2457)
  - Updated ralph-setup wizard status display (lines 5346-5380)
  - Added new menu option "Configure 1Password Environments" (lines 5385-5430)
  - Added `_ralph_setup_configure_op_environments()` helper (lines 5711-5812)

### Learnings
- 1Password Environments use `op://` reference format: `op://vault/item/field`
- Common patterns: `.env.1password` file or `op://` refs in `.env*` files
- Status display should reflect actual configuration state, not just tool presence
- Configuration guidance should be actionable with specific commands

## Iteration 9 - US-041: Enhanced archive skill with cleanup option
**Status**: COMPLETED

Upgraded the archive skill from a single-file knowledge skill to a full progressive disclosure structure with bash functions:

### Skill Structure Created
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/archive/SKILL.md` - Main router with quick actions table
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/archive/workflows/archive-snapshot.md` - Timestamped archive workflow
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/archive/workflows/cleanup-completed.md` - Cleanup and reset workflow
- Removed old `skills/archive.md` single-file skill
- Updated symlink: `~/.claude/commands/archive` now points to directory

### New Features in ralph-archive
- `--keep` flag: Archive only, skip cleanup prompt
- `--clean` flag: Archive and auto-cleanup without prompt
- (no flag): Interactive prompt using `gum confirm` (fallback to `read -q`)
- Archives `progress.txt` alongside PRD files
- Creates fresh `progress.txt` after cleanup with "Fresh Start" header
- Proper stats reset: completed=0, recalculates total from remaining stories
- Preserves blocked array when rebuilding pending

### Functions Modified
- `ralph-archive()` - Added flag parsing loop (lines 3882-3928)
- `_ralph_archive_json()` - Added mode parameter, gum confirm support (lines 3930-3989)
- `_ralph_archive_cleanup()` - New function for cleanup logic (lines 3991-4086)
- `_ralph_archive_md()` - Updated with mode parameter for consistency (lines 4088-4169)

### Tests Added (6 new tests)
- `test_archive_parses_keep_flag` - Verifies --keep flag parsing
- `test_archive_parses_clean_flag` - Verifies --clean flag and story removal
- `test_archive_copies_progress_txt` - Verifies progress.txt archiving
- `test_archive_cleanup_creates_fresh_progress` - Verifies fresh progress.txt
- `test_archive_cleanup_resets_stats` - Verifies index.json stats reset
- `test_archive_rejects_unknown_flags` - Verifies error on invalid flags

### Learnings
- `gum confirm` defaults to "No" with `--default=false`
- ZSH arrays are 1-indexed, so `${array[1]}` is first element
- When rebuilding index.json, preserve blocked array but rebuild pending from remaining files
- Archive first, then cleanup - ensures full history preservation
- Use `(N)` glob qualifier to handle empty directories gracefully

## Iteration 10 - US-042: Pre-commit hook runs tests
**Status**: COMPLETED

Added test suite execution to the pre-commit hook. Tests now run automatically on every commit, ensuring code quality is maintained.

### Changes Made
- `.githooks/pre-commit` - Added step 7 (Test Suite) that runs `tests/test-ralph.zsh`
- Restructured hook to run tests for ALL commits (not just when .zsh files staged)
- Steps 1-5 (syntax checks) only run when .zsh files are staged
- Steps 6-8 (JSON validation, tests, AGENTS.md sync) always run
- Updated all step numbers from 7 to 8 total

### Files Modified
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/.githooks/pre-commit` - Added test suite section
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/scripts/setup-hooks.sh` - Updated summary to mention test suite
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/CLAUDE.md` - Added pre-commit test hook documentation

### Learnings
- Pre-commit hooks should run tests for ALL commits, not just code changes
- Tests ensure any config/schema changes don't break functionality
- Execution time: ~1 second total (35 tests + all checks)
- `--no-verify` is built-in git feature for bypassing hooks

## Iteration 11 - BUG-003: fswatch background job outputs TTY noise
**Status**: COMPLETED

Fixed the fswatch background job to stop outputting job control messages like `[4] 73252` and `suspended (tty output)`.

### Root Cause
When ZSH starts a background job with `(...)&`, it outputs job control messages. Additionally, background processes trying to write to stdout can trigger "suspended (tty output)" messages.

### Solution
1. Added `setopt LOCAL_OPTIONS NO_MONITOR NO_NOTIFY` before starting the background job
2. Changed from `(...)&` to `{...} </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1 &` to detach from TTY
3. Used ZSH coproc to start fswatch/inotifywait and capture its PID
4. Stored fswatch PID in `/tmp/ralph_watcher_$$_pid` for precise cleanup
5. Updated `_ralph_stop_watcher()` to kill both the wrapper shell and the actual fswatch process

### Files Modified
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/ralph.zsh`
  - `_ralph_start_watcher()`: Added TTY detachment, coproc usage, PID file creation
  - `_ralph_stop_watcher()`: Added PID file-based cleanup for precise process termination

### Learnings
- `setopt NO_MONITOR NO_NOTIFY` suppresses ZSH job control output
- `&!` disowns immediately but doesn't capture PID in `$!`; use `& ; disown` instead
- Pipelines in backgrounded braces need special handling - `coproc` provides cleaner PID capture
- FIFO writes inside subshells with redirected outer stdout still work because they use explicit file paths
- When using `disown`, `wait` won't work on the process, so kill and brief sleep is sufficient

## Iteration 12 - US-035: Worktrees skill (task isolation)
**Status**: COMPLETED

Created `/worktrees` skill for git worktree-based task isolation. Enables creating isolated working directories for each task, preventing cross-contamination between branches.

### Skill Structure Created
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/worktrees/SKILL.md` - Router with quick actions table
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/worktrees/workflows/create.md` - Create worktree from branch name
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/worktrees/workflows/list.md` - List active worktrees
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/worktrees/workflows/switch.md` - Navigate between worktrees
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/worktrees/workflows/cleanup.md` - Remove completed worktrees
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/worktrees/workflows/from-linear.md` - Create worktree from Linear issue
- Symlinked to ~/.claude/commands/worktrees

### Features
- Default path: `~/worktrees/<repo>/<branch>`
- Linear integration: Auto-generates branch names from Linear issues (branchName field)
- Custom branch naming options: feature/ENG-123-description, fix/ENG-456-description
- Interactive selection with gum integration
- Shell function (`wt`) for quick switching with fuzzy matching
- Safe cleanup workflow with merge verification
- VS Code/Cursor integration instructions

### Learnings
- Linear issues have `branchName` field with auto-sanitized branch names
- `git worktree add <path> -b <branch>` creates worktree with new branch
- `git worktree remove <path>` removes worktree and cleans git references
- `git worktree prune` cleans up stale references from deleted directories
- Skills that are purely markdown (no standalone scripts) don't need zsh typecheck

## Iteration 13 - US-047: Script-backed Convex skill (deterministic execution)
**Status**: COMPLETED

Upgraded the Convex skill to use the deterministic script pattern from docs/skill-creation-guide.md. Scripts execute WITHOUT loading code into context - only output enters the conversation.

### Scripts Created
- `skills/convex/scripts/dev.sh` - Start dev server with auto-cleanup of orphan .js files
- `skills/convex/scripts/deploy.sh` - Production deployment with optional 1Password key retrieval
- `skills/convex/scripts/run-function.sh` - Execute queries/mutations/actions with arg validation
- `skills/convex/scripts/export-data.sh` - Database backup with timestamped filename
- `skills/convex/scripts/import-data.sh` - Data import with safety prompts and backup warnings

### Script Pattern Applied
All scripts follow the deterministic pattern:
- `set -e` for exit on error
- Color-coded output (RED/GREEN/YELLOW/BLUE)
- `-h/--help` flag for usage documentation
- Structured output (SUCCESS/ERROR prefix) for agent parsing
- Input validation before execution

### SKILL.md Updated
Added "Available Scripts" section with usage table:
```markdown
| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `scripts/dev.sh` | Start dev server with auto-cleanup | `bash ~/.claude/commands/convex/scripts/dev.sh` |
| `scripts/deploy.sh` | Deploy to production | `bash ~/.claude/commands/convex/scripts/deploy.sh --1p` |
...
```

### Workflows Simplified
All workflow files (dev.md, deploy.md, etc.) now:
- Route to scripts in "Quick Start" section
- Document options via tables
- Provide examples and troubleshooting
- No longer contain inline bash code blocks for execution

### Files Modified
- `skills/convex/scripts/dev.sh` - NEW
- `skills/convex/scripts/deploy.sh` - NEW
- `skills/convex/scripts/run-function.sh` - NEW
- `skills/convex/scripts/export-data.sh` - NEW
- `skills/convex/scripts/import-data.sh` - NEW
- `skills/convex/SKILL.md` - Added "Available Scripts" section
- `skills/convex/workflows/dev.md` - Simplified to route to script
- `skills/convex/workflows/deploy.md` - Simplified to route to script
- `skills/convex/workflows/run-function.md` - Simplified to route to script
- `skills/convex/workflows/data-export.md` - Simplified to route to script
- `skills/convex/workflows/data-import.md` - Simplified to route to script

### Learnings
- Scripts execute without loading code into context - only output enters conversation
- Agent invokes script, gets clean result - no interpretation, no construction, no errors
- Workflows become routing docs, not execution instructions
- Structured output (SUCCESS/ERROR prefix) enables reliable agent parsing
- Pre-written scripts are more reliable than generated code

## Iteration 14 - US-048: Audit all skills for script-backed pattern compliance
**Status**: COMPLETED

Audited all skills and upgraded Linear, Archive, and Ralph-install to the script-backed pattern.

### Skills Audit Results

**Already Script-backed (before this iteration):**
- `convex` - 5 scripts (dev.sh, deploy.sh, run-function.sh, export-data.sh, import-data.sh)
- `1password` - 2 scripts (migrate-env.sh, scan-mcp-secrets.sh)

**Upgraded to Script-backed:**
- `linear` - 3 new scripts
- `archive` - 2 new scripts
- `ralph-install` - 3 new scripts

**MD-only (no scripts needed):**
- `skills.md` - Discovery only
- `github.md` - Routes to gh CLI
- `brave.md` - Browser tool reference
- `prd.md` - PRD generation
- `critique-waves.md` - Agent orchestration
- `worktrees` - Simple git commands

### Scripts Created

**Linear Skill (`skills/linear/scripts/`):**
- `create-issue.sh` - Create Linear issues with priority, labels, assignee
- `list-issues.sh` - List/search issues with filters (--my, --team, --search, --issue)
- `create-worktree.sh` - Create git worktree from Linear issue with branch name

**Archive Skill (`skills/archive/scripts/`):**
- `archive-snapshot.sh` - Create timestamped PRD archive
- `cleanup-completed.sh` - Archive then remove completed stories

**Ralph-install Skill (`skills/ralph-install/scripts/`):**
- `check-deps.sh` - Check all required dependencies
- `install-deps.sh` - Install missing deps via Homebrew
- `validate.sh` - Full installation validation

### SKILL.md Updates

Added "Available Scripts" table to:
- `skills/linear/SKILL.md`
- `skills/archive/SKILL.md`
- `skills/ralph-install/SKILL.md`

### Documentation

Added "When to Use Scripts vs Workflows" section to `docs/skills.md`:
- When to use scripts: API calls, multi-step operations, validation
- When to use workflows: Simple CLI commands, decision trees, documentation
- Script template pattern with colors, help, structured output

### All Scripts Pass Pattern Requirements
- `set -e` for exit on error
- Color-coded output (RED/GREEN/YELLOW/BLUE)
- `-h/--help` flag for usage
- Structured output (SUCCESS/ERROR prefixes)

### Learnings
- 8 new scripts total, all pass bash -n typecheck
- Script-backed skills are more reliable than inline code blocks
- Workflows become routing docs that point to scripts
- Pattern: SKILL.md has "Available Scripts" table at top

## Iteration 15 - US-049: Hot-reload update.json each iteration
**Status**: COMPLETED

Implemented hot-reload of update.json at the START of each Ralph iteration, allowing new stories to be injected mid-run without waiting for the current batch to complete.

### Changes Made

**Enhanced `_ralph_apply_update_queue()` function:**
- Now processes `newStories` array: creates story files in `stories/`, adds to `pending` and `storyOrder`
- Now processes `updateStories` array: merges changes into existing story files
- Recalculates all stats after processing: `total`, `completed`, `pending`, `blocked`
- Sets `nextStory` based on updated `pending` array
- Sets `RALPH_UPDATES_APPLIED` global for caller to display count
- Clears `newStories` from index.json after processing
- Deletes `update.json` after successful processing

**Moved update check to START of iteration loop:**
- Check happens BEFORE `_ralph_json_next_story()` is called
- Ensures newly injected stories are immediately available
- Also calls `_ralph_auto_unblock()` to handle blocker resolution

**Updated message output:**
- Shows "📥 Applied N new story/stories from update.json" when stories are added
- Message appears at both iteration start and after final loop

### Files Modified
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/ralph.zsh`
  - `_ralph_apply_update_queue()`: Complete rewrite with newStories/updateStories support
  - Main loop: Added update check at START of each iteration (line ~2698)
  - Between iterations: Removed redundant update check (was line ~3351)
  - After loop: Updated to show message when stories applied (line ~3413)

### Learnings
- While loops in ZSH run in subshells, so counters inside don't persist - use jq to re-count
- ZSH glob `(N)` qualifier handles empty directories gracefully
- `jq -c '.array[] | .'` iterates array items as compact JSON, one per line
- Stats recalculation must read all story files to count `passes: true`
- `nextStory` should be set to first item in `pending` array or `null` if empty

## Iteration 16 - BUG-004: Display stats don't refresh after update.json merge
**Status**: COMPLETED (already fixed by US-049)

This bug was automatically fixed as part of the US-049 implementation. The `_ralph_apply_update_queue()` function now:
1. Recalculates all stats (total, completed, pending, blocked) from story files
2. Writes fresh stats to index.json immediately after applying updates
3. All display functions read from index.json directly, so they get fresh values

### Verification
Tested with a scenario:
- Initial: 5 total, 3 completed, 2 pending (displayed as 3/5 = 60%)
- Added 2 new stories via update.json
- After update: 7 total, 3 completed, 4 pending (displayed as 3/7 = 42%)

Stats refresh correctly because:
- `_ralph_apply_update_queue()` recalculates stats from story files
- Stats are written to index.json immediately
- `_ralph_show_iteration_status()` reads from index.json (not cached)
- Progress bar shows fresh values on next display

No additional code changes needed - US-049 fix covered this bug.

## Iteration 17 - BUG-005: Ralph keeps looping after PRD complete
**Status**: COMPLETED

Fixed the bug where Ralph would keep looping after all stories were complete, burning tokens unnecessarily.

### Root Cause
When `_ralph_json_next_story()` returned empty (no pending stories), Ralph didn't check for this condition. It would continue looping without any story to work on.

### Solution
Added a check right after getting `current_story` in the main iteration loop (line 2715-2762):
1. If `current_story` is empty AND we're in JSON mode
2. Check if `pending` array length is 0
3. If so, display completion message and exit with code 0

### Completion Message Format
Normal mode:
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  ✅ PRD Complete! All N stories finished.                      ║
╠───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╣
║  ⏱️  Total time: Xm Ys                                         ║
║  💰 Total cost: $X.XX                                          ║
║  🔄 Iterations: N                                              ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Compact mode:
```
✅ PRD COMPLETE! All N stories finished │ Xm Ys │ $X.XX
```

### Features
- Graceful exit with return 0
- Stops file watcher before exiting
- Sends notification if enabled
- Shows total time, cost, and iterations
- Cleans up temp files

### Files Modified
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/ralph.zsh` (lines 2715-2762)

### Learnings
- Check for empty story BEFORE the iteration starts, not just at completion signals
- The `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` signal was intended for when Claude reports completion, but Ralph itself needs to detect the empty-pending case
- Exit early, not late - don't burn an iteration asking Claude "what's the next task?" when there are none

## Iteration 18 - BUG-006: Debug output 'remaining_stats' leaking to display
**Status**: COMPLETED

Fixed the debug output `remaining_stats='0 0'` that was leaking to the terminal when user's shell had xtrace enabled.

### Root Cause
When a user's shell has `set -x` (xtrace) enabled globally, ZSH outputs debug traces to stderr for each command/assignment. The `_ralph_json_remaining_stats` function was being called in several places WITHOUT `2>/dev/null`, allowing xtrace output to leak to the terminal.

Lines 3261, 3316, and 3388 were calling `_ralph_json_remaining_stats` without stderr redirection, while lines 3403 and 3475 already had `2>/dev/null`.

### Solution
1. Added `2>/dev/null` to all calls of `_ralph_json_remaining_stats` that were missing it:
   - Line 3261: `skip_stats=$(_ralph_json_remaining_stats "$PRD_JSON_DIR" 2>/dev/null)`
   - Line 3316: `error_stats=$(_ralph_json_remaining_stats "$PRD_JSON_DIR" 2>/dev/null)`
   - Line 3388: `blocked_stats=$(_ralph_json_remaining_stats "$PRD_JSON_DIR" 2>/dev/null)`

2. Added belt-and-suspenders protection by adding `setopt localoptions noxtrace` at the start of the `_ralph_json_remaining_stats` function itself.

### Files Modified
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/ralph.zsh`
  - `_ralph_json_remaining_stats()`: Added `setopt localoptions noxtrace` (line 2242)
  - Line 3261: Added `2>/dev/null` to skip_stats assignment
  - Line 3316: Added `2>/dev/null` to error_stats assignment
  - Line 3388: Added `2>/dev/null` to blocked_stats assignment

### Learnings
- ZSH xtrace outputs to stderr, so `2>/dev/null` suppresses it when capturing command output
- `setopt localoptions noxtrace` only takes effect AFTER it executes, so the setopt line itself may still produce trace output
- For belt-and-suspenders protection, use BOTH: noxtrace in the function AND `2>/dev/null` at call sites
- The output format `varname='value'` is the telltale sign of xtrace debug output

## Iteration 19 - BUG-007: Per-project ntfy topics not working
**Status**: COMPLETED

Fixed the bug where config file `ntfyTopic` value was overriding per-project topic logic, causing all Ralph instances to send notifications to the same fixed topic.

### Root Cause
When config file had `ntfyTopic` set (even to defaults like "ralph-notifications"), it was loaded into `RALPH_NTFY_TOPIC` global variable. Later, the per-project fallback logic `${RALPH_NTFY_TOPIC:-${RALPH_NTFY_PREFIX}-${project_name}}` never triggered because `RALPH_NTFY_TOPIC` was already set.

### Solution
1. Changed config loading logic to only set `RALPH_NTFY_TOPIC` if the config value is non-empty, not "auto", and not "null"
2. Empty string `""` or `"auto"` in config now enables per-project topics (recommended default)
3. Updated `ralph-setup` wizard to offer "Per-project topics (recommended)" vs "Fixed topic" choice
4. Updated both gum and fallback (read-based) setup flows

### Files Modified
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/ralph.zsh`
  - Config loading (lines 1195-1200): Added conditional to skip setting `RALPH_NTFY_TOPIC` for empty/"auto" values
  - Setup wizard gum flow (lines 892-909): Added topic mode choice
  - Setup wizard fallback flow (lines 944-972): Added topic mode choice
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/docs/notifications.md`
  - Added "Config File (ralph-config.json)" section explaining per-project vs fixed topic configuration

### Learnings
- Config values of empty string, "auto", or not set should all enable per-project behavior
- Setup wizards should default to per-project and make fixed topic opt-in
- The display at line 2677 already correctly shows the actual topic being used

## Iteration 20 - BUG-008: Live criteria updates not wired up
**Status**: COMPLETED

Wired up the live progress update infrastructure so that criteria and stories progress bars update in real-time during Claude execution.

### Problem
The infrastructure existed (fswatch, FIFO, `_ralph_poll_updates`, `_ralph_handle_file_change`, `_ralph_update_criteria_display`) but `_ralph_handle_file_change` was never called during the main loop. The criteria progress bar never updated during iteration execution.

### Solution
1. Created `_ralph_start_polling_loop()` function that runs in background:
   - Reads from the FIFO with 0.2s timeout
   - Calls `_ralph_handle_file_change()` when file changes detected
   - Uses `{ ... } &` with `disown` to run without blocking

2. Created `_ralph_stop_polling_loop()` function to cleanly terminate the polling loop

3. Integrated with Claude execution:
   - Start polling loop BEFORE the Claude command (line 3137-3140)
   - Stop polling loop AFTER the Claude command finishes (line 3258-3259)

### Files Modified
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/ralph.zsh`
  - Added `RALPH_POLLING_PID` global variable (line 613)
  - Added `_ralph_start_polling_loop()` function (lines 615-649)
  - Added `_ralph_stop_polling_loop()` function (lines 651-662)
  - Added polling loop start before Claude command (lines 3137-3140)
  - Added polling loop stop after Claude command (lines 3258-3259)

### How It Works
1. fswatch monitors `prd-json/stories/` and `prd-json/index.json`
2. When files change, fswatch writes filenames to FIFO
3. Background polling loop reads from FIFO every 0.2s
4. `_ralph_handle_file_change()` dispatches to:
   - `_ralph_update_criteria_display()` for story JSON changes
   - `_ralph_update_stories_display()` for index.json changes
5. Progress bars update in-place using ANSI escape codes

### Learnings
- ZSH subshells created with `{ ... } &` inherit functions and variables at fork time
- Global variables modified before fork are visible to child process
- ANSI escape sequences can update display in-place without affecting Claude's output
- Background subshells can write to parent's terminal via printf

## Iteration 21 - US-052: Audit Skills for Structure Compliance
**Status**: COMPLETED

Audited all skills in `~/.claude/commands/` against the reference pattern (github skill: SKILL.md + workflows/ + scripts/).

### Audit Results

**Fully Compliant (6 skills):**
- github - SKILL.md + 4 workflows + 2 scripts
- 1password - SKILL.md + 5 workflows + 2 scripts
- archive - SKILL.md + 2 workflows + 2 scripts
- convex - SKILL.md + 7 workflows + 5 scripts
- linear - SKILL.md + 4 workflows + 3 scripts
- ralph-install - SKILL.md + 5 workflows + 3 scripts

**Partially Compliant (1 skill):**
- worktrees - SKILL.md + 5 workflows, NO scripts/ directory
  - Acceptable: only wraps simple git commands

**Non-Compliant (2 skills):**
- brave.md - Single file, references complex CLI with many subcommands
  - Recommendation: Expand to directory with workflows
- critique-waves.md - Single file, complex multi-phase workflow
  - Recommendation: Expand to directory with workflows + scripts

**Appropriate as Single File (2 skills):**
- prd.md - Linear workflow/instruction document
- skills.md - Single-purpose discovery utility

### Files Created
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/docs.local/skill-audit-report.md`

### Learnings
- Reference pattern: SKILL.md router + workflows/ for decision trees + scripts/ for deterministic bash
- Single .md is appropriate for: linear instruction docs, single-purpose utilities
- Directory structure needed for: multi-operation skills, complex CLIs, multi-phase processes
- Skills missing scripts/ are only an issue if they reference bash commands that should be deterministic

## Iteration 22 - US-053: Generate Fix Stories for Non-Compliant Skills
**Status**: COMPLETED

Based on the skill audit report from US-052, created stories in update.json to fix the two non-compliant skills.

### Stories Created

**US-059: Expand brave.md to Progressive Disclosure Structure**
- Priority: medium
- Story Points: 3
- Converts single-file brave.md into directory structure
- Creates SKILL.md router + 4 workflows (navigation, inspection, interaction, debugging)
- No scripts/ needed since brave-manager is already an external CLI tool

**US-060: Expand critique-waves.md to Progressive Disclosure Structure**
- Priority: medium
- Story Points: 3
- Converts single-file critique-waves.md into directory structure
- Creates SKILL.md router + 3 workflows (setup, run-wave, iteration)
- Creates scripts/init-tracker.sh for initialization

### Files Modified
- `prd-json/update.json` - Added US-059 and US-060 to newStories array

### Learnings
- Stories should specify exact files to create, not just general goals
- Reference pattern (github skill) should be explicitly mentioned in acceptance criteria
- Independence constraint prevents circular dependencies between fix stories

## Iteration 23 - BUG-009: Auto-convert string criteria to object format
**Status**: COMPLETED

Fixed the bug where `update.json` stories with string acceptance criteria (e.g., `["criterion 1", "criterion 2"]`) broke `ralph-status` and live progress updates, which expect the object format (`[{text: "...", checked: false}]`).

### Solution

Added `_ralph_normalize_criteria()` helper function that:
- Detects if `acceptanceCriteria` contains strings using `jq type == "string"`
- Converts strings to `{text: string, checked: false}` objects
- Preserves existing object criteria as-is (checked value maintained)

Applied normalization in two places:
1. When creating new story files from `newStories` array (line 2187)
2. When merging updates from `updateStories` array (line 2211)

### Files Modified
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/ralph.zsh`
  - Added `_ralph_normalize_criteria()` function (lines 2140-2158)
  - Updated story file creation to normalize (line 2187)
  - Updated story merge to normalize (line 2211)
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/tests/test-ralph.zsh`
  - Added `test_update_queue_converts_string_criteria()` test

### Test Added
New test verifies:
- String criteria are converted to object format
- Mixed criteria (strings + objects) work correctly
- Existing object criteria preserve their `checked` state

### Learnings
- jq `type` function returns "string" or "object" for distinguishing formats
- Normalization should happen at ingestion time, not display time
- Using a helper function keeps the main logic clean and testable

## Iteration 24 - BUG-010: Live criteria updates still not working
**Status**: COMPLETED

Fixed the live criteria progress updates that weren't updating during Claude execution.

### Root Cause
When ZSH creates a background subshell with `{ ... } &`, variables are **copied at fork time**. The polling loop was started in a subshell that had `RALPH_CRITERIA_ROW=0` and `RALPH_STORIES_ROW=0` because those globals were only set AFTER the subshell forked.

### Solution
Pass row positions as function parameters to `_ralph_start_polling_loop()`, which become local variables captured at call time. The subshell then has correct values.

```zsh
# Before: subshell sees stale globals
_ralph_start_polling_loop "$story" "$dir"

# After: row positions passed as params
_ralph_start_polling_loop "$story" "$dir" "$RALPH_CRITERIA_ROW" "$RALPH_STORIES_ROW"
```

### Changes Made

**New Functions:**
- `_ralph_debug_live()` - Debug logging for live updates (enable with `RALPH_DEBUG_LIVE=true`)
- `_ralph_update_criteria_display_at_row()` - Update criteria bar at explicit row
- `_ralph_update_stories_display_at_row()` - Update stories bar at explicit row
- `_ralph_handle_file_change_with_rows()` - Handle file changes with explicit row positions

**Modified Functions:**
- `_ralph_start_watcher()` - Added debug logging
- `_ralph_start_polling_loop()` - Now accepts row positions as params 3 and 4
- Caller site now passes `$RALPH_CRITERIA_ROW` and `$RALPH_STORIES_ROW`

**Documentation:**
- Created `docs/live-updates.md` explaining the architecture

### Files Modified
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/ralph.zsh`
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/docs/live-updates.md` (NEW)

### Learnings
- ZSH background subshells (`{ ... } &`) copy variables at fork time
- Parent's subsequent variable updates are NOT visible to forked subshell
- Solution: Pass values as function parameters, which become locals captured at call time
- Debug logging controlled by env var (`RALPH_DEBUG_LIVE=true`) is a feature, not temporary code

## Iteration 25 - US-054: Add Tests for All Skills
**Status**: COMPLETED

Created a comprehensive test suite that validates all skills follow the correct structure and their scripts/workflows are functional.

### Test File Created
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/tests/test-skills.zsh` - 14 tests total

### Tests Implemented

**Structure Validation Tests:**
- `test_directory_skills_have_skill_md` - Verifies all directory skills have SKILL.md
- `test_skill_md_has_required_sections` - Checks for YAML frontmatter and Quick Actions section
- `test_workflow_files_have_proper_structure` - Validates workflow files have title and content
- `test_scripts_directory_exists_when_referenced` - Ensures scripts/ exists when SKILL.md references it
- `test_scripts_are_executable` - Verifies all .sh scripts are executable
- `test_scripts_have_shebang` - Checks scripts start with shebang
- `test_scripts_pass_syntax_check` - Validates scripts pass `bash -n`

**Specific Skill Compliance Tests:**
- `test_github_skill_compliant` - Validates github skill structure
- `test_convex_skill_compliant` - Validates convex skill structure
- `test_1password_skill_compliant` - Validates 1password skill structure
- `test_linear_skill_compliant` - Validates linear skill structure
- `test_archive_skill_compliant` - Validates archive skill structure
- `test_ralph_install_skill_compliant` - Validates ralph-install skill structure
- `test_worktrees_skill_compliant` - Validates worktrees skill (no scripts required)

### Issues Fixed During Testing
- Made scripts executable in archive, linear, ralph-install skills
- Fixed workflow file title detection to handle YAML frontmatter

### Pre-commit Hook Updated
- Added skills tests to run alongside ralph tests in step 7
- Both test suites must pass for commit to succeed

### Files Modified
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/tests/test-skills.zsh` (NEW)
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/.githooks/pre-commit` - Added skills test execution
- Multiple scripts made executable (+x)

### Learnings
- YAML frontmatter in workflow files means title detection needs to look for `#` after `---` blocks
- Testing skill structure at commit time ensures no regressions
- Separate test files for different concerns keeps tests organized

## Iteration 26 - US-066: Add PRD Skill Reference to CLAUDE.md Files
**Status**: COMPLETED

Updated CLAUDE.md files to point Claude to the `/prd` skill for PRD and Ralph-related work.

### Changes Made

**~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (global):**
- Added "When Working with PRDs or Ralph" section pointing to `/prd` skill
- Lists key use cases: creating PRDs, adding stories, story format, update.json pattern

**ralphtools/CLAUDE.md:**
- Added `/prd` skill reference under Ralph-specific rules
- Documents: story JSON structure, file locations, update.json pattern

### Verification of /prd Skill
The skill already contains comprehensive documentation:
- Story JSON template with `acceptanceCriteria: [{text, checked}]` format
- File locations: `prd-json/index.json`, `prd-json/stories/*.json`
- update.json pattern for safe story additions
- AGENTS.md template with story ID rules

No changes needed to the skill itself - documentation was already complete.

### Learnings
- CLAUDE.md should point to skills rather than duplicate their documentation
- Skills are the authoritative source; CLAUDE.md provides discovery/routing
- The `/prd` skill is well-documented with templates for all PRD structures

## Iteration 27 - US-067: Update 1Password Skill for Environments Feature
**Status**: COMPLETED

Updated the /1password skill to document 1Password Environments (beta) as the PREFERRED approach for .env management.

### Changes Made

**skills/1password/SKILL.md:**
- Added "🌟 PREFERRED: 1Password Environments (Beta)" section before Quick Actions
- Documented UI setup flow: 1Password app → Developer → Environments → Create → Import .env
- Documented mount destination: Destinations tab → set path → creates named pipe
- Documented limitations table: CLI invisible, edits in UI only, header marker, beta status
- Added link to official docs: https://developer.1password.com/docs/environments/
- Referenced songscript as working example (9 vars, .env.local mounted)
- Added "When to Use CLI Instead" section for automation/CI/CD cases

**skills/1password/workflows/migrate-env.md:**
- Added "🌟 RECOMMENDED: 1Password Environments (UI)" section at top
- Step-by-step UI setup: Create Environment → Import .env → Set Mount Destination → Activate
- Moved CLI migration to "CLI Migration (Automation/CI/CD)" section as fallback
- Clarified when to use CLI: automation, CI/CD, .env.template sharing, headless servers

### Key Points Documented

1. **Environments is UI-based** - No CLI commands for setup; configured in 1Password app
2. **Named pipe mount** - Destination file is a pipe, not stored on disk
3. **CLI cannot see environments** - `op env list` doesn't show UI-created environments (beta limitation)
4. **Edits in UI only** - Changes to mounted file are lost; must edit in 1Password
5. **Header marker** - Mounted file shows `# Generated by 1Password`
6. **CLI as fallback** - Keep `op item create` for scripted/automated migrations

### Learnings
- 1Password Environments is superior to CLI migration for most use cases
- Named pipes provide real-time secret access without disk storage
- Beta limitations mean CLI and UI environments are currently separate
- Documentation should show preferred approach first, with fallback options

## Iteration 28 - US-055: Create registry schema and migration
**Status**: COMPLETED

Enhanced the `_ralph_migrate_to_registry()` function to support importing from repo-claude-v2.zsh alongside the existing projects.json and shared-project-mcps.json sources.

### Changes Made

**Enhanced `_ralph_migrate_to_registry()` function:**
- Now supports `--force` flag to regenerate registry from source configs
- Sources configs from three locations:
  1. `repo-claude-v2.zsh` (REPO_CONFIGS_V2, SUPABASE_TOKENS, LINEAR_TOKENS, MCP_UNIVERSAL)
  2. `projects.json` (legacy format)
  3. `shared-project-mcps.json` (global MCPs)

**repo-claude-v2.zsh migration:**
- Parses REPO_CONFIGS_V2 (pipe-delimited: key|name|path|mcps_light|mcps_full) into projects
- Converts MCP_UNIVERSAL associative array to mcpDefinitions
- Maps SUPABASE_TOKENS to project secrets as `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- Maps LINEAR_TOKENS to project secrets as `LINEAR_API_TOKEN`
- Expands `$HOME` in project paths

**Registry output format:**
- version: "1.0.0"
- global.mcps: from shared-project-mcps.json
- projects: merged from repo-claude-v2.zsh + projects.json
- mcpDefinitions: from MCP_UNIVERSAL

### Files Modified
- `/Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/ralph.zsh`
  - `_ralph_migrate_to_registry()`: Complete rewrite with multi-source support

### Test Results
- 7 MCP definitions imported from MCP_UNIVERSAL
- 6 projects imported from REPO_CONFIGS_V2
- 4 Supabase tokens added to project secrets
- 2 Linear tokens added to project secrets
- Global MCPs imported from shared-project-mcps.json
- projects.json data merged

### Learnings
- ZSH case patterns with `===` need to be quoted: `"===PATTERN==="` not `===PATTERN===`
- ZSH debug output can leak from `local var=$(...)` when xtrace is enabled globally
- Use subshell to source external configs without polluting current environment
- Tab characters (`\t`) are reliable delimiters when parsing shell output
- `jq -n` with `--argjson` allows building complex JSON from shell variables

## Iteration 29 - US-056: Core registry functions
**Status**: COMPLETED (already implemented)

All core registry functions were already implemented in ralph.zsh during US-055 work. Verified:

### Functions Verified (lines 1641-1742)

1. **_ralph_load_registry()** (lines 1641-1647)
   - Checks if registry.json exists at RALPH_REGISTRY_FILE
   - Returns file contents via cat
   - Error message if not found

2. **_ralph_get_project_config()** (lines 1651-1663)
   - Takes optional path (defaults to cwd)
   - Resolves to absolute path with `:A`
   - Uses jq to find project matching the path
   - Handles ~ expansion in stored paths

3. **_ralph_current_project()** (lines 1667-1670)
   - Calls _ralph_get_project_config
   - Extracts just the project name via jq

4. **_ralph_build_mcp_config()** (lines 1674-1703)
   - Gets global MCPs from registry
   - Gets project-specific MCP names
   - Resolves MCP definitions from mcpDefinitions
   - Merges into {mcpServers: {...}} format

5. **_ralph_inject_secrets()** (lines 1707-1742)
   - Skips silently if op CLI not available
   - Gets project secrets from registry
   - Resolves op:// references via `op read`
   - Exports resolved values as env vars
   - Passes through non-op:// values directly

### Typecheck
- `zsh -n ralph.zsh` passes

### Learnings
- Registry infrastructure was built as part of US-055 migration work
- Functions already support the full workflow: load → find project → build config → inject secrets

## Iteration 30 - US-057: Ralph uses registry for MCPs
**Status**: COMPLETED

Integrated registry-based MCP configuration into the Ralph main loop. Different projects now automatically get different MCPs based on registry configuration.

### Changes Made

- Build MCP config from registry after project detection
- Write MCP config to temp file `/tmp/ralph-mcp-config-$$.json`
- Display project name with `📦 Project: {name}`
- Display MCPs with `🔌 MCPs: {list}`

**ralph.zsh - CLI command building (lines 3287-3295):**
- Add `--mcp-config` flag to Claude CLI if MCP config file exists
- Call `_ralph_inject_secrets` before each iteration to export secrets to environment

**ralph.zsh - _ralph_build_mcp_config (lines 1698-1723):**
- Enhanced to handle special MCPs (linear, supabase) that require project-specific tokens
- Dynamically builds MCP config using project secrets from registry
- Falls back to mcpDefinitions for standard MCPs

### Verification Results
- Domica MCPs: Context7, browser-tools, figma-local, figma-remote, linear, supabase, tempmail (7 MCPs)
- Songscript MCPs: Context7, browser-tools, tempmail (3 MCPs)
- Different projects get different MCPs ✓
- Typecheck passes ✓

### Learnings
- Claude CLI `--mcp-config` accepts JSON file path for MCP server configuration
- Linear MCP requires `LINEAR_API_TOKEN` env var, supabase requires token in args
- Special MCPs with project-specific tokens need dynamic config generation
- Temp files for MCP config cleaned up by cleanup_ralph() trap

## Iteration 31 - US-058: ralph-setup wizard enhancement for MCPs
**Status**: COMPLETED

Enhanced ralph-setup wizard to configure MCPs per project, select from mcpDefinitions, and migrate .env secrets to 1Password refs.

### Changes Made

**New helper function `_ralph_get_available_mcps()` (lines 6120-6131):**
- Gets available MCPs from registry mcpDefinitions
- Falls back to hardcoded RALPH_AVAILABLE_MCPS if registry not available

**Enhanced `_ralph_setup_configure_mcps_for_project()` (lines 6430-6515):**
- Now uses `_ralph_get_available_mcps()` instead of hardcoded list
- Shows available MCPs from registry mcpDefinitions
- Better UI with count display

**New MCP definitions management (lines 6517-6773):**
- `_ralph_setup_manage_mcp_definitions()` - Main menu with add/view/remove options
- `_ralph_setup_add_mcp_definition()` - Add new MCP with command, args, and env vars
- `_ralph_setup_view_mcp_definition()` - View MCP definition details as JSON
- `_ralph_setup_remove_mcp_definition()` - Remove MCP with warning about projects using it

**Enhanced `_ralph_setup_migrate_secrets()` (lines 6878-7001):**
- Scans .env files first and shows what secrets exist
- Counts plain secrets vs op:// refs already migrated
- New "Scan .env files (preview migration)" option
- Shows keys only (not values) for security

**Enhanced `_ralph_setup_view_config()` (lines 7036-7119):**
- Pretty-printed output with color coding and sections
- Shows registry version
- Projects section with all details (path, MCPs, secrets)
- MCP Definitions section with commands and env var counts
- Global MCPs section

**Updated main menu (lines 6181-6214):**
- Added "Manage MCP definitions" option
- Updated menu numbers to accommodate new option

### Learnings
- jq can iterate registry mcpDefinitions with `.mcpDefinitions | keys[]`
- Scanning .env files: use `grep -v "^#" | grep -v "^$" | grep "="` to find secrets
- Show keys only (`sed 's/=.*/=***/'`) when displaying secrets for security
- gum input with --placeholder provides good UX for interactive prompts
- Validate JSON with `echo "$json" | jq -e '.'` before writing to registry

- Auto-detects Ralph running via tee process or watcher PID
- Routes to update.json (Ralph active) or direct edit (Ralph not active)
- Supports --force-update and --force-direct flags
- Auto-generates story IDs if not provided
- Validates type, priority, and story points

### Ralph Detection Methods
1. `pgrep -f "tee /tmp/ralph_output_"` - Primary detection for active Ralph
2. `ls /tmp/ralph_watcher_*_pid` - Check for fswatch watcher PID files
3. `ls /tmp/ralph_pid_*` - Legacy PID file check

### Learnings
- Ralph detection via PID files is unreliable - tee process is more reliable indicator
- Use `printf '%s' "$var"` instead of `echo "$var"` to avoid trailing newlines in jq
- The update skill provides consistent interface for both Ralph and interactive Claude
- Test with --force-direct to simulate Ralph-not-running scenarios during Ralph sessions
