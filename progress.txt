# Ralph Progress - Fresh Start
Started: Fri Jan 23 21:57:15 IST 2026

(Previous progress archived to docs.local/prd-archive/)

## Iteration 1
Story: AUDIT-001 - Audit README.md for accuracy and relevance
Status: BLOCKED
Reason: AUDIT-001 depends on US-073 (Deprecate -G -H -K model flags) which is still pending.
The acceptance criteria "Remove -G -H -K examples (deprecated per US-073)" cannot be completed until US-073 is done.
Moved AUDIT-001 to blocked array, set nextStory to BUG-013.

### Learnings
- Always check dependencies[] field in story JSON before starting
- If a dependency story is not completed, the dependent story should be blocked

## Iteration 2
Story: BUG-013 - Debug output 'remaining_stats' still leaking to display
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Added `setopt localoptions noxtrace` to 10+ helper functions to prevent xtrace output leakage
- Functions guarded: _ralph_format_elapsed, _ralph_show_iteration_status, _ralph_get_story_criteria_progress, _ralph_get_total_criteria, _ralph_update_criteria_display_at_row, _ralph_update_stories_display_at_row, _ralph_handle_file_change, _ralph_handle_file_change_with_rows, _ralph_start_polling_loop, _ralph_ntfy
- Added debug output auditing section to docs/configuration.md with grep commands
- Added comment "# DEBUG OUTPUT - guard with RALPH_DEBUG_LIVE" above _ralph_debug_live function

### Learnings
- The xtrace output format `var='value value'` with single quotes indicates zsh trace output, not explicit echo
- `setopt localoptions noxtrace` prevents xtrace leakage within function scope
- Even if parent function sets noxtrace, it's good practice to guard all helper functions defensively

## Iteration 3
Story: BUG-014 - Ralph exits early when Claude falsely signals COMPLETE
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Created `_ralph_verify_pending_count()` helper function to check actual pending count
- Supports both JSON mode (checks pending array length) and PRD.md mode (counts `- [ ]` checkboxes)
- Updated main COMPLETE detection code to use the helper function
- Added 5 unit tests for the verification function (all pass)
- Fixed bug: grep -c returns exit code 1 with 0 matches, needs proper handling

### Learnings
- `grep -c` returns 0 (the count) but with exit code 1 when no matches - don't use `|| echo 0` which prints twice
- Proper pattern: `actual_pending=$(grep -c 'pattern' file 2>/dev/null) || actual_pending=0`
- Extract verification logic into testable functions for easier unit testing

## Iteration 4
Story: BUG-015 - Ralph says 'PRD Complete' when stories are blocked
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Modified completion check at line ~3197 in ralph.zsh to also check blocked count
- Added `blocked_count=$(jq -r '.blocked | length')` check alongside pending_count
- If pending=0 but blocked>0, shows "PRD Blocked: X stories need manual intervention" in yellow box
- Uses RALPH_COLOR_YELLOW for blocked state visual distinction
- Added 2 unit tests for blocked story completion logic (all 43 tests pass)
- Notification event "blocked" sends when PRD is blocked vs "complete"

### Learnings
- PRD completion state has 3 outcomes: complete (pending=0,blocked=0), blocked (pending=0,blocked>0), or in-progress
- Use different colors (green vs yellow) to visually distinguish completion states
- Singular/plural handling: "1 story" vs "X stories" for user-friendly messages

## Iteration 5
Story: BUG-016 - update.json format undocumented and confusing
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Added comprehensive update.json format documentation to skills/update/SKILL.md
- Documented that only `newStories` and `updateStories` arrays are processed
- Fixed update-story.md workflow: removed incorrect nested `changes` key format
- Fields in updateStories should be at top level with `id`, not nested under `changes`
- Added validation in `_ralph_apply_update_queue()` to warn about ignored fields
- Warning displays for any keys besides newStories/updateStories (e.g., storyOrder, pending)
- Tested merge functionality - story creation, index.json update, and update.json cleanup all work
- All 43 tests pass

### Learnings
- jq's `.[0] * .[1]` merge operator means updateStories fields must be at top level with id
- Documentation discrepancies can lead to silent failures (storyOrder/pending were being ignored)
- Adding validation warnings helps users catch format mistakes early

## Iteration 6
Story: US-052 - Audit Skills for Structure Compliance
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Scanned ~/.claude/commands/ for all 14 skills (11 directory-based, 3 single-file)
- Checked against reference pattern: github skill (SKILL.md + workflows/ + scripts/)
- Created comprehensive audit report at docs.local/skill-audit-report.md
- Found 6 fully compliant, 5 partially compliant, 3 non-compliant (single files)
- Critical finding: brave.md and brave/ both exist (duplicate skill)
- Medium priority: brave/, coderabbit/, worktrees/ have bash refs but no scripts/
- Low priority: critique-waves and update have sparse scripts/

### Learnings
- Single-file skills may be appropriate if simple/linear (prd.md, skills.md)
- Duplicate skills cause confusion (brave.md vs brave/ directory)
- Skills referencing external CLIs don't necessarily need scripts/ (already have CLI)

## Iteration 7
Story: US-070 - Convex skill: Complete user deletion pattern
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Created ~/.claude/commands/convex/workflows/user-deletion.md with complete deletion pattern
- Documented: find user by email (getUserByEmail query with by_email index)
- Documented: delete from auth tables (sessions, accounts, verificationTokens, users - order matters)
- Documented: delete from all app tables with userId foreign key (helper function pattern)
- Included table discovery query and grep command (discoverUserTables)
- Included complete deleteUserAndAllData mutation code with deletion report
- Documented required indexes (by_user, by_email) in schema.ts section
- Added CLI command: npx convex run admin:deleteUserAndAllData
- Updated SKILL.md Quick Actions table with link to new workflow
- All 8 acceptance criteria met

### Learnings
- Auth table deletion order matters: sessions→accounts→tokens→user (avoid FK issues)
- Include deletion report in response for audit/compliance tracking
- Table discovery requires manual schema.ts check (Convex has no introspection API)

## Iteration 8
Story: US-071 - Pre-commit test hook for ralphtools
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Pre-commit hook already existed at .githooks/pre-commit (git config core.hooksPath .githooks)
- Hook already runs tests/test-skills.zsh (lines 254-280)
- Hook already validates JSON files with jq (lines 198-214)
- Hook already exits non-zero on failure (lines 316-323)
- Hook already has --no-verify bypass documentation (line 321, setup-hooks.sh:90)
- Hook completes in ~2.6 seconds (< 10 seconds requirement met)
- ADDED: shellcheck for .sh files (lines 64-85) - previously only .zsh files had syntax checking
- shellcheck exclusions: SC1091 (sourced files), SC2034 (unused vars in sourced files)

### Learnings
- The pre-commit hook was 95% complete - only missing shellcheck for .sh files
- shellcheck doesn't support .zsh files (SC1071 error) - use zsh -n instead
- Hook uses .githooks/ directory with git config core.hooksPath (not .git/hooks/)

## Iteration 9
Story: US-072 - SongScript sources ralphtools skills via symlink
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Added "Skills System" section to ralphtools README.md with skill sourcing pattern
- Documented symlink mechanism: ~/.claude/commands/ → ~/.config/ralph/skills/
- Listed all available skills with descriptions (convex, 1password, github, linear, worktrees, prd)
- Documented how skills auto-update when pulling ralphtools
- Added skill sourcing documentation to SongScript CLAUDE.md
- Documented /convex workflows table in SongScript (dev, deploy, user-deletion, etc)
- Verified symlink: ~/.claude/commands/convex → ralphtools/skills/convex
- Confirmed skill frontmatter meets Claude Code discovery requirements

### Learnings
- Skills in ~/.claude/commands/ are global - accessible from any project
- SKILL.md frontmatter (name, description) is required for Claude Code skill discovery
- Symlinks allow skills to auto-update when the source repo is pulled
- SongScript benefits from Convex user-deletion workflow (US-070) immediately

## Iteration 10
Story: US-073 - Deprecate -G -H -K model flags in favor of smart routing
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Updated header comment in ralph.zsh: moved -H, -K, -G to "Deprecated Flags" section
- Added "Smart Model Routing (Recommended)" section pointing to config.json and ralph-setup
- Updated ralph-help function: -H, -K, -G now shown in gray with deprecation notice
- Removed model flag examples from help output (previously showed ralph 50 -G -H examples)
- Added "Smart Model Routing" section to help output with smart routing explanation
- Flag parsing code at lines 2812-2841 preserved for backwards compatibility
- README.md already had -G -H -K removed (only shows -O and -S)
- Unblocked AUDIT-001 (was blockedBy US-073)
- All 43 tests pass

### Learnings
- Deprecation = update docs + add warnings, but keep code working
- Historical design docs (docs/plans/) should not be modified for deprecation
- Always check for dependent stories to unblock after completing a story

## Iteration 11
Story: US-074 - Integrate CodeRabbit pre-commit check into ALL Ralph stories
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Tested CodeRabbit by creating test_bug.js with 4 intentional security vulnerabilities
- Bugs planted: SQL injection, null check, hardcoded credentials, eval() RCE
- CodeRabbit detected and reported all 4 issues with actionable fix prompts
- Fixed _ralph_coderabbit_review() to detect `Type: potential_issue` format (not just CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM)
- The --prompt-only output uses Type markers, not severity markers

### Learnings
- CodeRabbit `cr review --prompt-only` uses `Type: potential_issue` not CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM
- Need to grep for both output formats to handle different CR versions
- CR has rate limits (~7 min cooldown after several reviews)

## Iteration 12
Story: BUG-019 - Configurable error handling and reliable retry logic
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Added errorHandling section to config.json schema with 4 configurable fields:
  - maxRetries (default: 5) - max retries for general API errors
  - noMessagesMaxRetries (default: 3) - max retries for "No messages returned"
  - generalCooldownSeconds (default: 15) - wait time between general retries
  - noMessagesCooldownSeconds (default: 30) - wait time between "No messages" retries
- Updated ralph-config wizard (both gum and fallback modes) to allow customizing error handling
- Updated _ralph_load_config() to load errorHandling settings with backwards-compatible defaults
- Changed hardcoded retry/cooldown values to use config-loaded variables
- Added Node.js unhandled promise rejection error patterns:
  - "This error originated" (Node.js rejection preamble)
  - "promise rejected with the reason"
- Added 3 new unit tests for error handling config (all 46 tests pass)
- Documented error handling config in docs/configuration.md with full reference table

### Learnings
- OR sub-criteria in acceptance means implementing ANY ONE satisfies the requirement
- Existing `2>&1` redirection already captures stderr (the third OR option)
- Config defaults should use jq's `// value` syntax for backwards compatibility
- Shell variable expansion in echo uses ${var} for inline text (e.g., "Waiting ${cooldown} seconds...")

## Iteration 13
Story: MP-001 - Consolidate CLAUDE.md files into modular context system
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Analyzed 26 CLAUDE.md files totaling ~8,400 lines
- Created ~/.claude/contexts/ directory structure with tech/ and workflow/ subdirs
- Created base.md (~150 lines) with universal rules: CLAUDE_COUNTER, git safety, scratchpad, AIDEV-NOTE, docs fetching, thinking before doing
- Created tech contexts: nextjs.md (~300 lines), supabase.md (~150 lines), convex.md (~100 lines), react-native.md (~150 lines)
- Created workflow contexts: rtl.md (~100 lines), testing.md (~100 lines), design-system.md (~100 lines), ralph.md (~100 lines)
- Created scripts/context-migrate.zsh to analyze CLAUDE.md and suggest applicable contexts
- Added ralph-migrate-contexts command to ralph.zsh
- Migrated ralphtools CLAUDE.md to use context references (175 → 146 lines)
- Tested on domica (912 lines → ~62 lines projected, 94% reduction)
- Total system reduction: ~8,400 lines → ~4,400 lines (47% reduction)
- Created comprehensive README.md documentation for the context system

### Learnings
- next-intl guide alone accounts for ~350 lines duplicated across 5 projects
- Base rules (CLAUDE_COUNTER, git safety) appear in virtually every project
- Project-specific content is typically only ~50-100 lines after extraction
- Monorepo sub-apps may need different contexts than root CLAUDE.md

## Iteration 14
Story: AUDIT-001 - Audit README.md for accuracy and relevance
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Read and cross-referenced entire README.md with ralph.zsh code
- Verified -G -H -K examples were already removed (per US-073)
- Verified all CLI flags (-QN, -O, -S, --compact, --debug) exist in code
- Updated Commands table: added ralph-live, ralph-watch, ralph-archive, ralph-learnings, ralph-costs, ralph-start, ralph-cleanup
- Fixed `ralph-init` syntax (added [app] parameter)
- Updated Skills table: added /update, /archive, /brave, /coderabbit, /critique-waves, /skills
- Fixed "Adding Skills to a New Machine" section: replaced nonexistent ./scripts/setup-symlinks.sh with /ralph-install skill and manual script
- Verified smart routing documentation is accurate
- Verified all 5 external links work (GitHub, ntfy.sh, coderabbit.ai, superpowers, ghuntley.com)
- Verified MCP integration docs are accurate
- ZSH syntax check passed, all 46 tests pass

### Learnings
- Referenced scripts in docs should be verified to exist
- Command tables should include ALL commands from ralph-help, not just core ones
- Skills evolve over time - README skill list needs periodic updates

## Iteration 15
Story: US-075 - golem-powers:writing-skills - Meta-skill for creating executable skills
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Created skills/golem-powers/writing-skills/ meta-skill directory structure
- Created SKILL.md with comprehensive documentation:
  - Skill structure requirements (SKILL.md, scripts/, src/, workflows/)
  - Pattern A: Bash script execution (execute: scripts/default.sh)
  - Pattern B: TypeScript/Bun execution (execute: scripts/run.sh --action=default)
  - CLI pattern for --action and --env flags
  - Execution rule: Claude MUST run script IMMEDIATELY on skill load
- Created scripts/create-skill.sh template generator:
  - --name and --type (bash|typescript) arguments
  - Scaffolds complete skill structure with appropriate files
  - Auto-sets execute: frontmatter and chmod +x on scripts
- Created workflows/create.md (step-by-step skill creation)
- Created workflows/audit.md (structure verification checklist)
- Created example-bash/ skill with working hello.sh script
- Created example-typescript/ skill with working Bun index.ts
- Symlinked skills/golem-powers/ to ~/.claude/commands/golem-powers
- All shell scripts pass shellcheck

### Learnings
- Golem-powers skills differ from regular skills: they have execute: frontmatter
- The execute: field triggers immediate script execution on skill load
- Two patterns: bash for simple wrappers, TypeScript/Bun for complex logic
- Template generator reduces boilerplate and ensures consistent structure
- TypeScript skills need scripts/run.sh wrapper to call bun

## Iteration 16
Story: US-076 - golem-powers:context7 - Replace Context7 MCP with executable skill
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Researched Context7 API: REST at https://context7.com/api with /v2/libs/search and /v2/context endpoints
- Created skills/golem-powers/context7/ directory structure with scripts/ and workflows/
- Created SKILL.md with frontmatter (name: context7, description: Library documentation lookup, execute: scripts/default.sh)
- Created scripts/resolve-library.sh: searches for library by name, outputs Markdown table of results
- Created scripts/query-docs.sh: queries documentation for a library ID, outputs Markdown snippets
- Created scripts/default.sh: shows usage help when skill is loaded
- Created workflows/lookup.md: step-by-step guide for library documentation lookup
- Documented how to disable Context7 MCP after skill works
- All scripts pass shellcheck (removed unused SCRIPT_DIR variables)
- API authentication via CONTEXT7_API_KEY environment variable
- Skill inherits from golem-powers symlink (~/.claude/commands/golem-powers → ralphtools/skills/golem-powers)
- Verified expected output format using existing Context7 MCP tools
- All 46 tests pass

### Learnings
- Context7 has REST API at https://context7.com/api, requires API key with ctx7sk prefix
- MCP servers may have API keys managed server-side (not visible in user config)
- golem-powers skills can inherit from parent symlink, no separate symlink needed
- URL encoding in bash can use python3 -c "import urllib.parse; print(urllib.parse.quote(...))"

## Iteration 17
Story: US-077 - Refactor coderabbit skill to golem-powers executable pattern
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Moved skills/coderabbit/ to skills/golem-powers/coderabbit/
- Updated SKILL.md frontmatter with execute: scripts/review.sh
- Created 5 executable scripts:
  - review.sh: runs cr review --plain with Markdown output
  - security.sh: filters for security issues (injection, xss, csrf, auth, secrets)
  - secrets.sh: scans for hardcoded secrets and API keys
  - accessibility.sh: a11y audit filtering
  - pr-ready.sh: comprehensive PR check against main branch
- All scripts output proper Markdown with headers and tables
- Updated all workflow .md files (review, security, secrets, accessibility, pr-ready, verify) to reference scripts
- Removed old symlink ~/.claude/commands/coderabbit
- Verified ~/.claude/commands/golem-powers/coderabbit works via parent symlink
- Fixed SKILL.md: cr --base main → cr review --base main (CodeRabbit found this)
- All scripts pass shellcheck

### Learnings
- CodeRabbit CLI finds issues in documentation (good for catching incomplete examples)
- golem-powers executable skills inherit symlinks from parent, no separate link needed
- Scripts should output Markdown for consistent formatting across Claude Code
- Workflow files should show both script usage (recommended) and manual commands (alternative)

## Iteration 18
Story: MP-002 - Ralph loads modular contexts via --append-system-prompt
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Researched Claude CLI: uses --append-system-prompt <prompt> (string, not file)
- Created _ralph_build_context_file() function to concatenate context files
- Created _ralph_detect_tech_stack() for auto-detecting Next.js, Convex, Supabase, React Native
- Always loads base.md, workflow/ralph.md, then tech-specific contexts
- Generates merged context to /tmp/ralph-context-$$.md
- Added --append-system-prompt with file contents to cli_cmd_arr (Claude only)
- Added _ralph_cleanup_context_file() for cleanup after each iteration
- Removed ${brave_skill} and ${ralph_agent_instructions} variable injections (obsolete)
- Moved RALPH GIT RULES override to ~/.claude/contexts/workflow/ralph.md
- Added contexts section to _ralph_load_config() with directory and additional array support
- Documented modular context system in README.md
- All 46 tests pass

### Learnings
- Claude CLI uses --append-system-prompt <prompt> not --append-system-prompt-file
- Context file contents can be passed as the prompt argument value
- Tech detection uses package.json, config files, and directory presence
- Context cleanup must happen per-iteration since file is generated in loop

## Iteration 19
Story: US-078 - Migrate all existing skills to golem-powers namespace
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Moved all directory-based skills to skills/golem-powers/:
  - 1password, archive, brave, convex, critique-waves, linear, ralph-install, worktrees
- Converted single-file skills to directories with SKILL.md:
  - github.md → golem-powers/github/SKILL.md
  - prd.md → golem-powers/prd/SKILL.md
  - skills.md → golem-powers/skills/SKILL.md
- All skills already had proper YAML frontmatter (name, description)
- Removed old symlinks from ~/.claude/commands/ (1password, archive, brave, etc.)
- Single golem-powers symlink already existed and works for all skills
- Updated ralph.zsh skill references to use golem-powers namespace:
  - /1password → /golem-powers:1password
  - /prd → /golem-powers:prd
- skills/ now only contains golem-powers/ subdirectory
- Verified all skills accessible via /golem-powers:skillname
- All 46 tests pass

### Learnings
- Git detects moves correctly when using `mv` command (R100 = 100% rename)
- update/ skill mentioned in criteria doesn't exist - was already deprecated
- All existing skills already had proper YAML frontmatter from previous iterations
- Single golem-powers symlink + subdirectories is cleaner than multiple individual symlinks

## Iteration 20
Story: US-079 - golem-powers:create-pr - Adapt create-pr skill from Union
Status: COMPLETED (opus)
Changes:
- Created scripts/create-pr.sh with full argument parsing (--title, --body, --base)
- Pushes current branch with -u flag: git push -u origin HEAD
- Creates PR using gh pr create with proper Markdown output
- Edge case: Protected branch detection (main/master/dev) with helpful message
- Edge case: Uncommitted changes detection with git status output
- Edge case: Existing PR detection using gh pr view
- Auto-generates title from branch name (feature/add-login -> Add login)
- Auto-generates body with commit log if not provided
- chmod +x applied, shellcheck passes
- Verified symlink via parent golem-powers symlink works
- Tested edge cases: protected branch warning, uncommitted changes warning

### Learnings
- gh pr view returns JSON with url, title, state fields when PR exists
- git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD gets current branch name
- Branch name to title: sed to strip prefix, tr to convert dashes/underscores to spaces
