Started: Mon Jan 26 00:22:11 IST 2026

(Previous progress archived to docs.local/prd-archive/)

## Iteration 1 - V-140: Mock test 1 - long sleep test
- Model: opus
- Completed all 10 sleep test criteria (steps 4-10 were done in this iteration, 1-3 were already completed)
- Each step involved running `sleep 20 && echo 'Step N'`
- All criteria passed successfully
- Story marked as complete

## Iteration 2 - V-141: Mock test 2 - long sleep test
- Model: opus
- Completed all 10 sleep test criteria (steps 1-10)
- Each step involved running `sleep 20 && echo 'Step N'`
- Final step echoed 'V-141 complete'
- All criteria passed successfully
- Story marked as complete

## Iteration 3 - V-142: Mock test 3 - long sleep test
- Model: opus
- Completed all 10 sleep test criteria (steps 1-10)
- Each step involved running `sleep 20 && echo 'Step N'`
- Final step echoed 'V-142 complete'
- All criteria passed successfully
- Story marked as complete

## Iteration 4 - BUG-001: Config defaultModel not respected without CLI flag
- Model: kiro
- Fixed RALPH_DEFAULT_MODEL assignment to use config value directly instead of fallback pattern
- Removed 'local' keywords that were outside function scope causing zsh syntax errors
- Verified config defaultModel now properly sets the default when no CLI flag is specified
- Verified CLI flags (-S, -K, etc.) still override config as expected
- All tests passed (205 passed, 0 failed)
- CodeRabbit review passed with no issues
- Story marked as complete
- Root cause: The `${RALPH_DEFAULT_MODEL:-$_ralph_cfg_model}` pattern was backwards - it only used config if RALPH_DEFAULT_MODEL was unset, but it was already set to "opus" by default
- Learning: Always check variable assignment order when debugging config precedence issues
