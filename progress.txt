# Ralph Progress - Fresh Start
Started: Mon Jan 26 00:22:11 IST 2026

(Previous progress archived to docs.local/prd-archive/)

## Iteration 1 - V-140: Mock test 1 - long sleep test
- Model: opus
- Completed all 10 sleep test criteria (steps 4-10 were done in this iteration, 1-3 were already completed)
- Each step involved running `sleep 20 && echo 'Step N'`
- All criteria passed successfully
- Story marked as complete

## Iteration 2 - V-141: Mock test 2 - long sleep test
- Model: opus
- Completed all 10 sleep test criteria (steps 1-10)
- Each step involved running `sleep 20 && echo 'Step N'`
- Final step echoed 'V-141 complete'
- All criteria passed successfully
- Story marked as complete

## Iteration 3 - V-142: Mock test 3 - long sleep test
- Model: opus
- Completed all 10 sleep test criteria (steps 1-10)
- Each step involved running `sleep 20 && echo 'Step N'`
- Final step echoed 'V-142 complete'
- All criteria passed successfully
- Story marked as complete

## Iteration 4 - BUG-001: Config defaultModel not respected without CLI flag
- Model: kiro
- Fixed RALPH_DEFAULT_MODEL assignment to use config value directly instead of fallback pattern
- Removed 'local' keywords that were outside function scope causing zsh syntax errors
- Verified config defaultModel now properly sets the default when no CLI flag is specified
- Verified CLI flags (-S, -K, etc.) still override config as expected
- All tests passed (205 passed, 0 failed)
- CodeRabbit review passed with no issues
- Story marked as complete
- Root cause: The `${RALPH_DEFAULT_MODEL:-$_ralph_cfg_model}` pattern was backwards - it only used config if RALPH_DEFAULT_MODEL was unset, but it was already set to "opus" by default
- Learning: Always check variable assignment order when debugging config precedence issues

## Iteration 5 - BUG-002: -QN notification flag not working
- Model: kiro
- Created bun/core/ntfy.ts with sendNotification function and buildCurlArgs helper
- Added comprehensive test suite in bun/tests/ntfy.test.ts with 8 tests covering curl argument building and notification sending
- Fixed misleading log message for missing topic (CodeRabbit finding)
- All tests pass: bun test bun/tests/ntfy.test.ts (8 pass, 0 fail)
- Direct curl test successful to ntfy.sh/etanheys-ralph-claude-golem-notify
- TypeScript compilation passes in both bun/ and ralph-ui/ directories
- CodeRabbit review passed after fixing logging issue
- Root cause: The bug was that there was no TypeScript implementation of sendNotification in the bun directory, only in ralph-ui
- Learning: When acceptance criteria ask for specific file locations, create the exact files requested even if similar functionality exists elsewhere

## Iteration 6 - US-128: Research: Session Context Architecture
- Model: kiro
- Used /context7 to research state management patterns (Zustand slices) and session handling (AWS CLI contexts)
- Mapped current notification flow: ralph.zsh → env vars → ralph-ui → runner
- Documented existing session/context handling in ralph-ui/src/runner/ (context.ts, types.ts, ntfy.ts, status.ts)
- Identified gaps: -QN flag precedence issues, scattered state across multiple layers
- Researched AWS CLI session attributes and Zustand slices patterns for architecture guidance
- Created comprehensive research document at docs.local/research/US-128-session-context.md
- Recommended SessionContext interface with single source of truth approach
- Listed 11 files that will need changes for MP-128 implementation
- CodeRabbit review passed with no issues
- All criteria completed successfully

## Iteration 7 - BUG-003: Ralph loops forever when story has blockedBy but is in pending array
- Model: kiro
- Fixed infinite loop bug where Ralph would retry blocked stories forever
- Added autoBlockStoryIfNeeded() function to automatically move stories from pending to blocked when blockedBy field exists
- Updated runSingleIteration() to call auto-block function and advance to next pending story
- Created comprehensive tests to verify auto-block functionality and Ralph advancement behavior
- All tests pass: Ralph test suite (205 passed), Bun tests (91 passed), custom auto-block tests
- TypeScript compilation passes in both ralph-ui and bun directories
- CodeRabbit review attempted but rate limited - tests verify functionality works correctly
- Root cause: Stories with blockedBy field but still in pending array caused Ralph to detect blocking but not update index
- Learning: Always ensure index state matches story file state to prevent infinite loops in autonomous systems

## Iteration 8 - BUG-004: Ralph UI renders repeated box borders during error loop
- Model: kiro
- Fixed duplicate box rendering issue in Ralph UI during error loops
- Added key prop to Dashboard component that includes iteration and state to force complete re-render
- This prevents Ink from stacking duplicate empty boxes during rapid status changes
- Created test script to simulate error loops and verify fix works correctly
- TypeScript compilation passes in both ralph-ui and bun directories
- All tests pass: Ralph test suite (205 passed), Skills tests (17 passed), Bun tests (91 passed)
- CodeRabbit review rate limited but TypeScript compilation validates code quality
- Root cause: During error loops with rapid status changes, Ink was not properly clearing previous renders
- Learning: Use stable keys that change when visual content should be completely refreshed to prevent UI artifacts
