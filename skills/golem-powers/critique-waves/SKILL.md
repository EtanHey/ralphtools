# Critique Waves

> Run iterative waves of verification agents until consensus is achieved. Useful for verifying PRs, code changes, or any work that needs multi-agent validation.

## Quick Actions

| What you want to do | Workflow |
|---------------------|----------|
| Set up verification folder and tracker | [workflows/setup.md](workflows/setup.md) |
| Run a wave of parallel agents | [workflows/run-wave.md](workflows/run-wave.md) |
| Handle failures and iterate to consensus | [workflows/iteration.md](workflows/iteration.md) |

---

## Available Scripts

Execute directly - they handle errors and edge cases:

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `scripts/init-tracker.sh` | Initialize verification folder with templates | `bash ~/.claude/commands/critique-waves/scripts/init-tracker.sh <branch-name> [goal]` |

---

## Core Concept

Critique Waves uses multiple parallel agents to verify code changes. Each agent independently checks the same files against FORBIDDEN/REQUIRED patterns. By requiring multiple consecutive passes from all agents, we achieve high-confidence verification.

## Decision Tree

**Setting up for a new verification?**
- Create verification folder with templates
- Use: [workflows/setup.md](workflows/setup.md) or `scripts/init-tracker.sh`

**Ready to run agents?**
- Launch wave of 3 parallel agents
- Use: [workflows/run-wave.md](workflows/run-wave.md)

**Agent returned a FAIL?**
- Fix issues, reset pass count, iterate
- Use: [workflows/iteration.md](workflows/iteration.md)

---

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER run more than 3 agents in parallel** - Hard limit for Mac performance
2. **Agents write to separate files** - No shared state (round-N-agent-X.md)
3. **Update tracker after EACH wave** - Log results immediately
4. **Reset pass count on ANY failure** - Even one fail = reset to 0
5. **All files in ONE folder** - `docs.local/<BRANCH>/`
6. **Maximum 10 rounds** - Escalate to user if no consensus

---

## Example Session

```
Setting up docs.local/feature-branch/...
Created instructions.md and tracker.md

Wave 1: Launching 3 agents...
Results: Agent 1 PASS, Agent 2 FAIL (found forbidden pattern), Agent 3 PASS
Consecutive: 0 (reset due to failure)

Fixing issue found by Agent 2...

Wave 2: Launching 3 agents...
Results: All 3 PASS
Consecutive: 3

Wave 3: Launching 3 agents...
Results: All 3 PASS
Consecutive: 6

...

Wave 7: Launching 3 agents...
Results: All 3 PASS
Consecutive: 21

GOAL ACHIEVED: 21 consecutive passes (exceeded 20 goal)
```
