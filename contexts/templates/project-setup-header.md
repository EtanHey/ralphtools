## Example Usage

Add this section at the TOP of your project's CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## SETUP (AI: Read This First)

**Purpose:** [What this repo does - 1-2 sentences]

**Quick Start:**
1. [First step to understand the codebase]
2. [Second step]
3. [Any other essential steps]

**Skills Available:** Use `/skills` to see available skills. Key ones for this project:
- `/skill-name` - What it does
- `/another-skill` - What it does

**Self-Improvement Loop:** When working on this repo, you ARE dogfooding the tools you build:
- Skills you create → used by future Claude sessions
- Contexts you write → loaded into future CLAUDE.md files
- Bugs you find → should become PRD stories

**Contexts:** See @context: refs below for inherited rules.
```
